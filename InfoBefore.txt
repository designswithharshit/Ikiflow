==========================================================================
Welcome to Ikiflow 2.4.4
Release Date: February 2026
==========================================================================

Thank you for choosing Ikiflow. This installer will guide you through 
setting up your new focus companion. Our goal is to help you reclaim your 
time with minimal friction.

WHAT TO EXPECT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Clean Installation:
   Ikiflow runs 100% locally on your machine. All your data (focus history, 
   settings, and logs) is stored in a simple JSON file within your 
   installation folder. We do not upload your personal activity data to 
   the cloud.

2. System Impact:
   This application is lightweight (~50MB) and optimized for low CPU usage. 
   It installs a small background monitor to detect when you open productive 
   apps (like VS Code or Photoshop) to help you trigger flow states 
   automatically.

3. Privacy First:
   Ikiflow detects active window titles solely to trigger the "Quick Start" 
   feature. This data is processed in real-time on your PC and is never 
   transmitted externally.

BETA NOTICE:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
While we have tested this release extensively, Ikiflow is constantly 
evolving. If you encounter any unique behaviors (or if the Ghost Button 
is too hard to catch!), please use the in-app "Feedback" tool to let us 
know.
